    "# Transform data streams with Aiven for Apache Flink®\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this additional tutorial is to showcase how data in Apache Kafka can be read and manipulated using Apache Flink.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Apache Flink®️?\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Flink is stream processor that allows you to transmit a subset of your data based on a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to run your normal processes and analyze your messages in real-time and output \n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to execute this tutorial you need an Aiven for Apache Flink service. Instructions for this setup are detailed in the [Workshop README](README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "After a couple of minutes, the service will be up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Filtering pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll create a new streaming data pipeline to filter pizza `Hawaii` from the `pizzas` topic. To create such pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the Aiven for Apache Kafka service page, **Topics** tab\n",
    "2. Create a new topic called `pizzaFiltered`\n",
    "3. Navigate to the Aiven for Apache Flink®️ service page\n",
    "4. Create an integration between the Aiven for Apache Flink®️ service and the Aiven for Apache Kafka®️ service\n",
    "5. Navigate to the **Applications** tab\n",
    "6. Create a new Application named `filtering`\n",
    "7. Create a new version\n",
    "8. In the source table section:\n",
    "    * Select the integration with Aiven for Apache Kafka®️\n",
    "    * Include the following SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```sql\n",
    "      CREATE TABLE pizzas(\n",
    "        id INT,\n",
    "        name STRING,\n",
    "        pizza STRING\n",

    "        'scan.startup.mode' = 'earliest-offset'\n",
    "      )\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "9. In the sink table section:\n",
    "    * Select the integration with Aiven for Apache Kafka®️\n",
    "    * Include the following SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```sql\n",
    "      CREATE TABLE pizzas_filtered(\n",
    "        id INT,\n",
    "        name STRING,\n",

    "        'properties.bootstrap.servers' = '',\n",
    "        'scan.startup.mode' = 'earliest-offset'\n",
    "      )\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "10. In the transformation sql section include the following SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    INSERT INTO pizzas_filtered \n",
    "    SELECT * FROM pizzas WHERE pizza LIKE 'Hawaii%'\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "11. Click **Save and deploy later**\n",
    "12. Click **Create deployment**\n",
    "13. Click **Deploy without savepoint**\n",
    "14. Check in Aiven for Apache Kafka®️ that the data is filled in the `pizzaFiltered` topic with only pizzas Hawaii\n",

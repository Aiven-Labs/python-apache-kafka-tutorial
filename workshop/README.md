# Getting Started with this Workshop

In this workshop we will use Aiven for Apache Kafka® to deploy and manage our Apache Kafka® Service.

We'll also be using this notebook environment. By the end of this notebook, you will have:

- Created an Aiven Account
- Created a Aiven for Apache Kafka® service
- Downloaded your needed ssl certificates
- Setup your developer environment

## Setting up your workspace

### Your Developer Environment

Let's turn to our repo. We need to make sure we have all the tools needed for this workshop.

You have a few options that we recommend.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are already in a Codespace/GitPod environment, skip the next steps

### GitHub Codespaces


The easiest is GitHub Codespaces. This is a cloud driven environment provided by GitHub that you can use to ensure you can follow along.

GitHub provides 40 hours of codespaces available to you for free every month.

You will also have all of the python requirements installed for you making it easier to get started.

To use GitHub Codespaces, select the badge below.

### GitPod

Similar to Codespaces, GitPod is a service you can use to deploy a prepared environment making it easy to get started.

To use GitPod, select the badge below and create a gitpod account.

Once the environment is loaded, you will need to install your python requirements

## Create your Aiven Account

For this workshop, we'll be using Aiven to be the home for our Kafka Cluster.

You can create a free trial at <https://go.aiven.io/ft-signup-kafka-python>.
